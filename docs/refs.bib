  abstract="With the increased adoption of Hadoop-based big data systems for the analysis of large volume and variety of data, an effective and common benchmark for big data deployments is needed. There have been a number of proposals from industry and academia to address this challenge. While most either have basic workloads (e.g. word counting), or port existing benchmarks to big data systems (e.g. TPC-H or TPC-DS), some are specifically designed for big data challenges. The most comprehensive proposal among these is the BigBench benchmark, recently standardized by the Transaction Processing Performance Council as TPCx-BB. In this paper, we discuss the progress made since the original BigBench proposal to the standardized TPCx-BB. In addition, we will share the thought process went into creating the specification, challenges in navigating the uncharted territories of a complex benchmark for a fast moving technology domain, and analyze the functionality of the benchmark suite on different Hadoop- and non-Hadoop-based big data engines. We will provide insights on the first official result of TPCx-BB and finally discuss, in brief, other relevant and fast growing big data analytic use cases to be addressed in future big data benchmarks.",
